# DevOps-in-90

- This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of DevOps.
- I will be starting this journey on the 27th November 2022 and idea to take this upto 90 days
- The reason for documenting the journey is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.

- Goal
   - Atleast 1-2 hours/day => try to grasp as much as I can
   
 => Inspired from [Michael Cade's 90DaysOfDevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps) and [Kunal Verma's DevOps90](https://github.com/verma-kunal/DevOps-90).

 => Following Roadmap of [Saiyam Pathak Sir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l_n97Mt0ko&feature=youtu.be).
